 * -	For Tests 4 and 5, before attempting to access a Student class method from 
 *      an array element, you must ensure the array element contains a Student 
 *      object. If the element is null and you attempt to call a member method, the 
 *      program will throw an Exception and crash. To verify the element is not 
 *      empty, compare the element to null ï¿½ if the element is not null, then it 
 *      contains a valid Student object.

     * =========================================
     * For this test you will add member fields and constructors to the Student class.
     *
     * The private member fields to add are a string to represent a last name, a string
     * to represent a first name and an int to represent an identification number.
     *
     * You will provide the default (no parameter) constructor and one overloaded constructor.
     * - The default constructor will set last and first names to empty strings ("") and set
     *   the id number to 1000000 (1 million).
     * - The overloaded constructor that will accept two strings (last name, first name) and
     *   one int (id number) and update the member fields the received values.
     *
     * After making the specified additions in the Student class, create and then return a
     * new Student object using the provided parameters.
     *
     * Tips:
     * - The application will not compile until the Test 1 and 2 are both completed.

	 * - GetFirstName
	 * - GetLastName
	 * - GetIDNumber
