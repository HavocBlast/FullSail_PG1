	* that sets name to "" and cost to 0.
	*
	* It should also have an overloaded constructor
	* that accepts 2 parameters:
	* - A string
	* - An int.
	*
	* Write getters/accessors for each data member.
	* They should be called GetName and GetCost.
	*
	* Write setters/mutators for each data member.
	* They should be called SetName and SetCost.
